Hi every one this is adaptive gaussian spectrum subtraction.

Thie method aims at building trainable connection between input and standard deviation in gaussian fucntion, 
such that the standard deviation can change with input after training, while the standard deviation in classic 
methods becomes fixed constant after training.
